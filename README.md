# rviaf

## Overview

This R package is forked from Stefanie Schneider’s original viafr
package at [GitHub](https://github.com/stefanieschneider/viafr). The
objective is to extend the original package to enable discovery of
social networks of coauthors from VIAF clusters. VIAF is an OCLC service
that combines multiple LAM (Library, Archive, and Museum) name authority
files into a single name authority service. It thus provides direct
access to linked names for the same entity across the world’s major name
authority files, including national and regional variations in language,
character set, and spelling. For more information go to
[VIAF](https://viaf.org/).

This R package uses the VIAF (Virtual International Authority File) API.
