abstract={Normalization rules are essential for interoperability between bibliographic systems. In the process of working with Name Authority Cooperative Program (NACO) authority files to match records with Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) and developing the Faceted Application of Subject Terminology (FAST) subject heading schema, the authors found inconsistencies in independently created NACO normalization implementations. Investigating these, the authors found ambiguities in the NACO standard that need resolution, and came to conclusions on how the procedure could be simplified with little impact on matching headings. To encourage others to test their software for compliance with the current rules, the authors have established a Web site that has test files and interactive services showing their current implementation.

annotation={The NACO rules lack general applicability and repeatability.\par
The ''first comma in subfield $a'' rule and the retention of subfield codes
restricts their application to MARC coded fields. Dublin Core elements lack
subfield coding so could yield different results.\par
Repeatability requires the algorithm to leave a normalized result unchanged. \
But NACO rules do not satisfy this requirment. The character following the
subfield delimiter is deleted.\par
NACO rules prohibit conflicts between established headings (1xx fields from
authority records) or between established headings and cross-references (4xx fields).
No cross-reference can normalize the same as an established heading.\par
Simplified normalization resulted in a huge increase in conflicts between
established headings and cross-references.\par}
